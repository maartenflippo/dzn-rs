# DZN-RS

A Rust library for reading [DZN](https://www.minizinc.org/doc-latest/en/spec.html#spec-model-instance-files) files.
The documentation can be found on https://docs.rs/dzn-rs.

The goal of the library is to be able to parse _all_ DZN files correctly. 
Before that there will not be a 1.0 release.
However, before that, the library may be useful for many DZN files nonetheless.

## Installation

To add this library as a dependecy to your project, run

```
cargo add dzn-rs
```
